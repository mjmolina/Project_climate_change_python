Some of the highly bleached colonies  still were white in color in late November but regained full pigment by the end of December 1996.",,,29-30C,,"Gradual warming occurred during July in Kaneohe Bay as solar input increased and wind speed diminished.  By 21 Aug 1996 mean SST in Kaneohe Bay reached 28.5 C and was increasing rapidly. Wind speed dropped to a low level.  Solar radiation input was at near annual maximum with little cloud cover. Corals throughout the inner portion of Kaneohe Bay began to show signs of stress including contracted polyps mucous secretion and some discoloration. Maximum mid-day temperature on the reef began to exceed 30 C starting on 26 Aug 1996. By 31 August 1996 the daily mean SST exceeded 30 C with a daily mid day maximum approaching 30.7 C.  By this time the bleaching process was conspicuously underway in corals throughout the inner portion of the bay.  Corals in the lagoon area directly in front of the main building of the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology experienced higher temperatures due to restricted circulation and were highly bleached by 26 August 1996. Large tracts of corals throughout the inshore portion of Kaneohe Bay became highly bleached by 4 September. The areas where significant amounts of bleaching occurred were confined to the inner portion of Kaneohe Bay. The proportion of coral heads that bleached throughout the affected area varied from less than 5% in some areas to 100% over large sections of reef.  The amount of bleaching diminished near stream discharge points or other areas where turbidity was high.  Bleaching decreased with depth especially in localized areas of high turbidity. The period of highest thermal stress occurred between 14 August and 5 September (22 days).  During this time period the mean daily temperature remained in the 29-30 C  range.  The corals became progressively more bleached throughout September even  though temperature was declining.  Maximum bleaching occurred from 2 to 4 weeks  after the peak of highest temperature.  A second less severe warming episode  developed in early October but peak temperature remained below 29 C and did  not appear to further increase the rate of bleaching.  By mid October  temperatures diminished into the normal range and recovery of bleached  corals was underway.  Corals that were only slightly bleached started to regain pigmentation.  The remaining zooxanthellae in the lower shaded portions of bleached colonies began to rapidly re-infect the upper surface bleached areas.  Corals that were highly bleached died or regained pigment very slowly. Most of the colonies throughout the bay had recovered by mid November.  Some of the highly bleached colonies  still were white in color in late November but regained full pigment by the end of December 1996.","Jokiel P.L. personal communication to  NOAA & ReefBase (18/7/2003)",,USA_HAW
